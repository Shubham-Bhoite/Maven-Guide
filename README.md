# What is Maven?
- Maven is a build automation tool primarily used for Java projects. It addresses two main aspects of building software: dependency management and project build lifecycle management.
- It simplifies the build process by managing dependencies, compiling source code, packaging it into a deliverable (such as a JAR file), and deploying it to a repository.
- Maven is based on the concept of a Project Object Model (POM), which is a central piece of information that manages a project‚Äôs build, reporting, and documentation.

# History and Evolution of Maven
- Maven was developed by the Apache Software Foundation and released in 2004.
- It was created to address the problems with Apache Ant, a popular build tool at the time. Maven was designed to simplify the build process, provide a uniform build system, and offer project information that could be shared among developers.
- Over the years, Maven has become one of the most widely used build tools in the Java ecosystem.
