# <h1 align="center">‚öôÔ∏è Maven-Guide</h1>

## üìò Introduction :
Maven Guide is a beginner-friendly resource to help you understand and use Apache Maven, a powerful build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. This guide covers the basics of Maven, including how to set it up, create and manage projects, handle dependencies, and run builds efficiently.
Whether you're a student, fresher, or developer new to Maven, this guide will help you get started quickly and confidently.


## What is Maven?
- Maven is a build automation tool primarily used for Java projects. It addresses two main aspects of building software: dependency management and project build lifecycle management.
- It simplifies the build process by managing dependencies, compiling source code, packaging it into a deliverable (such as a JAR file), and deploying it to a repository.
- Maven is based on the concept of a Project Object Model (POM), which is a central piece of information that manages a project‚Äôs build, reporting, and documentation.

## History and Evolution of Maven
- Maven was developed by the Apache Software Foundation and released in 2004.
- It was created to address the problems with Apache Ant, a popular build tool at the time. Maven was designed to simplify the build process, provide a uniform build system, and offer project information that could be shared among developers.
- Over the years, Maven has become one of the most widely used build tools in the Java ecosystem.

## Installing Maven
### Prerequisites:
- Ensure that Java is installed on the machine. Maven requires Java to run. The trainees should have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed and the JAVA_HOME environment variable set.

### Steps to Install Maven:

1.Download Maven:
- Go to the Maven official download page.
- Download the latest binary zip archive or tar.gz file.
  
2.Extract the Archive:
- Extract the downloaded archive to a directory of your choice (e.g. C:\\Program Files\\Apache\\maven on Windows or /usr/local/apache-maven on macOS/Linux).
  
3.Set Environment Variables:
- Windows:
1. Right-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer', then go to Properties ‚Üí Advanced System Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables.
2. Add a new system variable named MAVEN_HOME pointing to the Maven directory.
3. Append the bin directory of Maven to the Path system variable: C:\\Program Files\\Apache\\maven\\bin.

   
- macOS/Linux:
1. Open .bash_profile or .zshrc file in your home directory and add:

       export MAVEN_HOME=/usr/local/apache-maven
       export PATH=$MAVEN_HOME/bin:$PATH

2. Run source ~/.bash_profile or source ~/.zshrc to apply the changes.
   

4.Verify Installation:
- Open a terminal or command prompt and type mvn -version.
- You should see the Maven version information along with Java details if Maven is correctly installed.


## Setting up Maven in IDEs
- ### IntelliJ IDEA:

  1.Maven Integration :
  - IntelliJ IDEA has Maven integration built-in, so no additional setup is required.
  - When creating a new project, you can select Maven as the project type, and IntelliJ will automatically generate the pom.xml file and manage the project structure.
 
  2.Importing a Maven Project:
  - If you already have a Maven project, you can import it by opening IntelliJ and selecting File ‚Üí Open, then navigating to the pom.xml file of your project.

  3.Maven Tool Window:
  - IntelliJ provides a Maven tool window where you can run Maven goals, view the lifecycle, and manage dependencies directly from the IDE.
 
- ### Eclipse :

  1.Installing the Maven Plugin:
  - Eclipse requires the m2e plugin for Maven integration, though many versions of Eclipse come with this plugin pre-installed.
  - To install it manually: Help ‚Üí Eclipse Marketplace ‚Üí Search for "m2e" ‚Üí Install.
 
  2.Creating a Maven Project:
  -     Go to File ‚Üí New ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Maven ‚Üí Maven Project.
  - Follow the wizard to set up your project, specifying details like GroupId, ArtifactId, and packaging type.
 
  3.Importing a Maven Project:
  - If you have an existing Maven project, import it by selecting File ‚Üí Import ‚Üí Maven ‚Üí Existing Maven Projects, then point to the directory containing the pom.xml.

  4.Maven Integration:
  - Eclipse provides a "Maven" perspective that allows you to run Maven commands, manage dependencies, and configure the build lifecycle from within the IDE.

## Understanding the .m2 Directory and settings.xml
### The .m2 Directory: 
- Located in the user's home directory (e.g., C:\\Users\\YourName\\.m2 on Windows or /home/YourName/.m2 on macOS/Linux).
- Contains the repository folder where Maven stores downloaded dependencies. This is known as the local repository.
- You can delete this folder if you want to force Maven to re-download dependencies, but usually, Maven manages it automatically.

### settings.xml File:
- Located in the .m2 directory. This file allows you to customize the behavior of Maven globally across all projects.
- Common configurations include:
  - Mirror configuration to point Maven to a specific repository.
  - Proxy settings if you're behind a firewall or using a corporate network.
  - Local repository location customization.
  - Example settings.xml:
  -     <settings>
        <mirrors>
        <mirror>
            <id>central</id>
            <mirrorOf>central</mirrorOf>
            <url><http://mycompany.com/maven2></url>
        </mirror>
        </mirrors>
        <proxies>
        <proxy>
            <id>example-proxy</id>
            <active>true</active>
            <protocol>http</protocol>
            <host>proxy.mycompany.com</host>
            <port>8080</port>
        </proxy>
        </proxies>
        </settings>



## Project Object Model (POM)
- The POM (Project Object Model) is the core of a Maven project. Understanding the POM file is essential because it contains all the configuration details for a Maven project.


### Structure of a pom.xml File
- The pom.xml file is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project.
- Here‚Äôs a basic structure of a pom.xml file:
        
      <project xmlns="<http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0>"
         xmlns:xsi="<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance>"
         xsi:schemaLocation="<http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0>
                             <http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd>">
      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

      <groupId>com.example</groupId>
      <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
      <packaging>jar</packaging>

      <name>My App</name>
      <url><http://maven.apache.org></url>

      <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>junit</groupId>
            <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
            <version>4.12</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
      </dependencies>

      <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.8.1</version>
                <configuration>
                    <source>1.8</source>
                    <target>1.8</target>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
      </build>
      </project>


### Key Elements in POM
1.modelVersion:
- This specifies the version of the POM model being used. Currently, 4.0.0 is the default and most widely used version.

2.groupId:
- The groupId uniquely identifies your project across all projects. Typically, it follows the reverse domain name convention (e.g., com.example).

3.artifactId:
- The artifactId is the name of the jar without the version. It is the name of the project.

4.version:
- The version is the project‚Äôs current version. Maven uses this version to distinguish between different versions of the same project.
- Versions can be specific like 1.0.0, or they can include SNAPSHOT, which indicates a version in development.

5.packaging:
- The type of artifact this project produces. Common packaging types are jar, war, pom, etc.
- If omitted, jar is assumed by default.

6.name and url:
- These are optional elements used to provide a human-readable name and project URL.

7.dependencies:
- The dependencies section lists all the external libraries your project depends on. Maven will download these libraries automatically from the central repository or other specified repositories.

8.build:
- The build section is used to specify how the project should be built. This includes specifying plugins, custom build directories, resources, etc.


### Dependencies and Dependency Management
#### Dependencies:
- Dependencies are external libraries that your project needs to work. You specify these in the dependencies section of the POM.
- Maven automatically downloads the specified versions of dependencies and any transitive dependencies they require.
- Example :

      <dependencies>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
          <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
          <version>2.5.4</version>
        </dependency>
      </dependencies>
#### Transitive Dependencies:
- Maven resolves transitive dependencies automatically. For example, if your project depends on A, and A depends on B, Maven will include B as a dependency in your project.


### Maven Dependency Scopes and Profiles
#### 1. Dependency Scopes
- Maven provides several scopes for dependencies, each determining at what phase of the build process the dependency is available and whether it is included in the final artifact (e.g., a JAR or WAR file). Understanding these scopes is crucial for managing project dependencies effectively.
- Here‚Äôs a detailed explanation of each scope, with examples:
##### a. compile Scope
- Availability: The dependency is available in all phases of the build lifecycle, including compilation, testing, and packaging.
- Default Scope: If no scope is specified, Maven uses compile by default.

#### b. provided Scope
- Availability: The dependency is available at compile-time but is not included in the final artifact.
- Typical Use: Used for dependencies that are provided by the runtime environment, such as servlet APIs provided by an application server.

#### c. runtime Scope
- Availability: The dependency is not required for compilation but is needed during runtime, including execution and tests.
- Typical Use: Used for dependencies that are needed only at runtime, like JDBC drivers.

#### d. test Scope
- Availability: The dependency is available only for the test compilation and execution phases.
- Typical Use: Used for libraries that are required only for testing, such as JUnit or Mockito.

#### e. system Scope
- Availability: The dependency is available for compilation and testing but must be explicitly provided by the developer on the system.
- Typical Use: Used rarely when the dependency is not available in any remote repository and must be provided locally.
- Important: You must explicitly provide the path to the JAR file using the <systemPath> element.
